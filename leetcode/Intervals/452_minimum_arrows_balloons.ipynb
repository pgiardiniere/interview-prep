    "There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [x_start, x_end]` denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.\n",

    "Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with $x_{start}$ and $x_{end}$ is burst by an arrow shot at $x$ if $x_{start} \\le x \\le x_{end}$. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.\n",
